## Prerequisites

- BFT voting consensus algorithm
- Scarce fungible token in the state machine

## Desiderata

- Imposition of scarcity on voting within an unbonding period (both full nodes / lite clients)
- Imposition of cost on downtime
- Maximize amount of bonded stake

## Terminology

- Stakers: validators, delegators
- Validators: bonded, unbonding, unbonded
- Slash
- Equivocation
- Unbonding period

## Implementation

- Tracking of what stake contributed to which vote
- Proportional slashing of contributing stake on equivocation discovery
- Microslashing for prolonged downtime
- Split of stakers into validators / delegators due to TM O(n^2) voting (and desire for stake to be bonded)
- Inflation to pay for risk + operation of voting

### Particulars

- Instant redelegation

### Deviations

- Simplified accounting in slashing for past infractions
- Tombstone (limited to one slash event while bonded)

### Idiosyncrasies

- Must limit liquidity of stake due to proposer reward
- Unbonding delegations, redelegations cannot be canceled

## Future Improvements

### Light Client Efficiency

- Bisectable light client proofs
- Must slash for signatures when not bonded.
